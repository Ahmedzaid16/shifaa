The idea of the project: is to collect the largest
possible number of known and unknown prevalent diseases and divide them into groups according to the type of disease (disease specialization).
subsequently ,we have added the largest possible number of drugs available to treat these diseases in our application .

First we will talk about the sign up page:
It is the first interface in the program and is used to:
Register in the program for the first time by taking data from the user and create it in Database
such as :
1.	Name
2.	Email 
3.	Password 
4.	Confirm password

After logging in now we have an account.  pressing the sign in button, we will go to the log in page
Which requires the username, email and password registered in sign up

After adding the required medications in the previous frame and pressing the View Card button
This frame brings us the outfit that shows us the registered medicines (their type and quantity), in addition to the possibility of removing, reducing or increasing the number of medicines.
Note, the Confirm button does not work unless there are medicines saved from the previous frame

Now after completing the destination assigned to the user, we move to the manager interface.
Which starts with the sections designated for choosing the disease section. After selecting the section to be modified by the director, it is automatically transferred to the next destination.
